menuconfig MMC
	tristate "MMC/SD/SDIO card support"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  This selects MultiMediaCard, Secure Digital and Secure
	  Digital I/O support.

	  If you want MMC/SD/SDIO support, you should say Y here and
	  also to your specific host controller driver.

config EMBEDDED_MMC_START_OFFSET
	bool "MMC start sector offset"
	depends on MMC != n
	help
	  This enables a per-controller fixed offset in sectors / bytes to
	  the location of the master boot record in the device, and reduces
	  the capacity of the device by a corresponding amount.  This is
	  primarily used by embedded systems with embedded MMC storage where
	  the initial sectors are used by boot firmware.  If you do not know
	  if this applies to your system, say N here.


config MMC_DEBUG
	bool "MMC debugging"
	depends on MMC != n
	help
	  This is an option for use by developers; most people should
	  say N here.  This enables MMC core and driver debugging.
