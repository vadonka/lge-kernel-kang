config TSL2561
	tristate "TAOS TSL2561 light-to-digital convertor"
	depends on I2C
	help
	 Say yes bere to build support for the TAOS light to digital
	 convertor.  This chip has two light sensors. One is broadband
	 including infrared whilst the other measures only infrared.
	 Provides direct access via sysfs.

config ISL29018
	tristate "ISL 29018 light and proximity sensor"
	depends on I2C
	default n
	help
	 If you say yes here you get support for ambient light sensing and
	 proximity ir sensing from intersil ISL29018.
	 This driver will provide the measurements of ambient light intensity
	 in lux, proximity infrared sensing and normal infrared sensing.
	 Data from sensor is accessible via sysfs.
